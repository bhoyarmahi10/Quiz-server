# Quiz-server
This project implements a single-client quiz application using C and TCP socket programming. The server and client communicate over a TCP connection, where the client answers quiz questions sent by the server. After the quiz, the server displays the player’s score and updates a leaderboard maintained during the server’s runtime.
